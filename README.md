## Zoomates

Welcome to **Zoomates** - the *fun* and *interactive* social hub for those who embrace the spirit animal within!

### Project Description

- This application takes in a user's input of a series of questions about themselves and their personalities 
- The answers will be used to filter through a selection of spirit animals and returns the spirit animal with the most common attributes 
- The user is then allowed to share their new discoveries within a myriad of formats including social media, text messaging, email or physical copies 
- The sensitive information gathered is placed within a secure database and a user must give authorization before another user can search the database to view a profile 

---

### Special Features

- Interact with our improved **AI** spiritual guide to help consider the user's choices  
- Be able to share your spirit animal using [X] (https://twitter.com/ "X, formerly twitter"), [Facebook] (https://www.facebook.com/ "Facebook"), [Instagram] (https://www.instagram.com/ "Instagram") and [Snapchat] (https://www.snapchat.com/ "Snapchat")
